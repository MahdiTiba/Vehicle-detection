# Vehicle-detection
 implementation object detection using the very powerful YOLO model.

Many of the ideas in this notebook are described in the two YOLO papers: Redmon et al., 2016 and Redmon and Farhadi, 2016. 


    Detect objects in a car detection dataset
    Implement non-max suppression to increase accuracy
    Implement intersection over union
    Handle bounding boxes, a type of image annotation popular in deep learning
